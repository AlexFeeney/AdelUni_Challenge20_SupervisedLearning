## Overview of the Analysis



The purpose of the analysis is to train and evaluate a loan risk model.The financial data being assessed is lending data from a csv file containing a loan status (true or false) along side a number of variables, number of accounts, income etc. Varabiles tryuing to be used was loan status (healthy loan or high-risk loan).

The stage conducted were, data preparation which involved using pandas to import the data, building the logistic regression model & fitting the model with the training data. 

Folowing this the model was evalated agains tthe predictions generating a confusion matrix and classificiation report. 

Logistic Regression mathod was used. 

## Results

Accuracy scores:
    - Represents the proportion of correctly predicted intstances
    - Showing a high accuracarcy score 


Precision scores: 
    - shows a value of 0 or 1
    - used to measure the propporoation of true values. In this context the - precisions lable indicates the prpopportyion of correctly predicted healthy loans or unhealthy loanes



Recall scores:
     - Measures the proportion of true positive among actual positives
     - signgies the proprotion of corretly predicted high-risk / healthy loans

    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

In summary the machine learning model is showing a high level or accuracy and will recommend to use.
